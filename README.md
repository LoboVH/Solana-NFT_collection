## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Anchor

```anchor
anchor keys list
```
This will give the fresh **ProgramId**, update this in **Anchor.toml** and **lib.rs** in **declare_id!("<PROGRAM_ID>")**

then run,
```anchor
anchor build
```
This will generate **/target** folder in the root withn **idl** and **type** folder.

next step is to run **anchor test** , but before that make sure you have enough **SOL** by running,
```solana
solana balance
```
You could airdrop more using **CLI** command or get some SOL from [here](https://faucet.solana.com/)

Once you have enough **SOL** , go to test folder and customize the tests as per requirement and run:
```anchor
anchor test
```

This will deploy the program and run the tests.
